Teaching computers to understand how humans write and speak, known as natural language processing (NLP), is one of the oldest challenges in AI research. There has been a marked change in approach over the past two years, however. Where research once focused on developing specific frameworks for specific tasks, today powerful general-purpose language models can be fine-tuned for a wide variety of different tasks. While promising, efforts to this point have applied these general-purpose models to tasks (such as sentiment analysis) for which a human could produce the solution without additional background knowledge.
